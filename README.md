Hello! This is a project (https://hardestlanguage.github.io/) exploring which language is the hardest to learn. I want to make it fun and interactive for everyone to understand languages. The tools used here include html, css, and javascript.

I divided it into two aspects to discuss the difficulty of the five most commonly used languages in the world. One is the time required to learn, and the other is the number of characters in each language. Each page on the website has its own html, css, and javascript pages. The code for the first page is in index.html, main.css, main.js, for the second page it's in hour.html, hour.css, hour.js, and for the third page it's in alphabets.html, alphabets.css, alphabets.js.

For the presentation of the third page, I referenced the example of Matter.js. You can find the example here (https://codepen.io/vsueiro/pen/WNMWPoX).

I hope everyone finds this website interesting!
